  <h1>What Do I Want to Code For?</h1>
      <p>I want to code to improve Accessibility for people with disabilities and to explore data science by analyzing datasets and combining with earth and space science.
        I also want to share my creations (arts and crafts, short stories, dance covers) with the world and display my personal projects!</p>
