  <h1>What Do I Want to Code For?</h1>
      <p>My goals are to utilize coding as a tool to combat accessibility issues and to explore data science by analyzing datasets.
        In the future, I hope to build a fully-developed mobile application that provides study resources and tips tailored towards high school students and different learning styles including visual, kinesthetic, auditory, and reading/writing.
        Alongside building a mobile application, I hope to expand accessible computer science education towards younger students to increase their confidence in technical and career development skills, and creativity and critical thinking skills.
        I also want to share my creations (arts and crafts, short stories, dance covers) with the world and display my personal projects!
